# Chord Crafter
Chord Crafter is a digital MIDI instrument which allows musiscians, producers, beatmakers, or anybody to instantly build, playback, and record their own chords through the use of a DAW by tinkering with chord notation rather than thinking about individual notes within a chord or music theory.
